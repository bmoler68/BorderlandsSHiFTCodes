# Project-wide Gradle settings for the Borderlands SHiFT Codes project
# 
# This file contains global Gradle configuration properties that apply to
# all modules in the project. These settings control build performance,
# Android-specific behavior, and Kotlin configuration.
# 
# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:
# Gradle settings configured through the IDE *will override*
# any settings specified in this file.
# For more details on how to configure your build environment visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/build_environment.html

# JVM arguments for the Gradle daemon process
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# -Xmx2048m: Sets maximum heap size to 2GB for better build performance
# -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8: Ensures consistent file encoding across platforms
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

# Parallel execution configuration
# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. For more details, visit
# https://developer.android.com/r/tools/gradle-multi-project-decoupled-projects
# org.gradle.parallel=true

# AndroidX configuration
# AndroidX package structure to make it clearer which packages are bundled with the
# Android operating system, and which are packaged with your app's APK
# https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/androidx-rn
# Enables the use of AndroidX libraries instead of the legacy Support Library
android.useAndroidX=true

# Kotlin code style configuration
# Kotlin code style for this project: "official" or "obsolete":
# "official": Uses the official Kotlin coding conventions
# "obsolete": Uses the older Kotlin coding conventions (deprecated)
kotlin.code.style=official

# Android R class optimization
# Enables namespacing of each library's R class so that its R class includes only the
# resources declared in the library itself and none from the library's dependencies,
# thereby reducing the size of the R class for that library
# This optimization reduces APK size and improves build performance
android.nonTransitiveRClass=true
